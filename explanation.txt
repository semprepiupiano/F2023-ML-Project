cp1.1.login: To obtain this, we cracked the password to the live image and opened a terminal. The victim's login name was displayed before the "@" symbol in the terminal window.

cp1.2.timezone: In the live image, we went into the "Time and Date Settings" and saw that the Time zone was "America/Chicago". This is CST.

cp1.3.usernames: In Autopsy, we navigated through the file system to /home/johnnydoe461/.purple/logs/jabber/johnnydoe461@jwchat.org . The two folders within contained the various conversations the victim had along with the time stamps.

cp1.4.filename: The file "you-cheater.jpg" was found using the "Images/Videos" tab in Autopsy. The SHA-256 sum was generated using 'sha256sum'. 

cp1.4.modtime: The file "you-cheater.jpg" was found using the "Images/Videos" tab in Autopsy. The SHA-256 sum was generated using 'sha256sum'. 

cp1.5.attacktime: The time the attacker first made contact with the victim was identified in the /var/log/auth.log file. The first time "sshd" displayed messages for connections from an external IP was on November 3rd at 18:32:06.

cp1.5.attackerip: The IP address the first attack came from was identified in the /var/log/auth.log file as 10.46.1.105. We do NOT include the IP address 10.46.1.106 because this IP address was used in a LATER attempt by the attacker at 18:50, not in the first attempt.

cp1.5.victimip: We determined the victim's IP address by looking at DHCP offers logged in "/var/log/syslog". At 18:28:32, the victim's computer was offered a local address of 10.46.1.103, which is the local IP address that would have been used for the victim during the attack since it was offered right before the attack occurred.
